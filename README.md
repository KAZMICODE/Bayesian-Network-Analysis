# Bayesian-Network-Analysis
Developed a custom Bayesian Network model to understand the complex relationships between various factors and their impact on student outcomes.

## Overview:
This study utilizes a dataset collected by Prof. Jiten Hazarika, containing information on candidates' performance in the Common Entrance Examination (CEE), and other variables of which we are choosing (as of our interest) coaching classes {within Assam, outside Assam or not}, medium of instruction at Class XII {ENGLISH, OTHERS or ASSAMESE}, percentages secured at Class X and XII standards, and parents' occupations.

We aim to utilize Bayesian networks to model the variables affecting student performance in the CEE (Common Entrance Examination) and their conditional dependencies. Our objective is to identify patterns and insights that can enhance our understanding of how these variables are interconnected, ultimately categorizing student performance as average, good, very good, or excellent in the context of the CEE.

    "###### Using Bayesian Networks to Characterize Student Performance across Multiple Assessments of Individual Standards\n",
    "    This paper explores the use of Bayesian networks to analyze and summarize student performance across multiple modular assessments (referred to as mini-assessments) aligned with specific educational standards. The paper refers to understand how student performance on mini-assessments can be modeled using Bayesian networks, which are probabilistic graphical models. Two approaches are employed in the study:\n",
    "    1. A data-driven approach: In this approach, no constraints are imposed, and the network structure is learned directly from the data to reflect the empirical relationships between mini-assessments.\n",
    "    2. A learning trajectory (LT) approach: In this approach, constraints are imposed on the network structure to mirror the stages of a mathematical learning trajectory, providing insights into student learning progress.\n",
    "        Furthermore , it discusses the use of Bayesian networks in educational assessments, particularly in modeling relationships between sub-skills or knowledge components highlighting the advantages of using Bayesian networks for modeling student performance, providing a more detailed and interconnected understanding of the relationships between knowledge components. It also suggests potential applications of Bayesian networks in educational assessments, including on-the-fly inferences for educators, identifying important assessments, and validating expert-defined relationships between knowledge components.\n",

    "###### A Bayesian network to analyse basketball players’ performances: a multivariate copula-based approach\n",
    "    This paper discusses the application of Bayesian networks (BNs) to model the joint distribution of various performance indicators of basketball players.It highlights the need for a multivariate approach to better understand the interrelationships among various performance metrics. The main objective is to identify the probabilistic relationships among these indicators and determine the key factors influencing a player's winning percentage. In addition, the structural learning process, based on the hill climbing algorithm with bootstrap resampling and model averaging, is discussed, along with the validation of the Gaussian Copula assumption. The paper also discusses the potential application of BNs in sports analytics, suggesting that they can help predict team and player performance, inform strategic decisions, and improve overall decision-making in sports. The main goal is to identify the main determinants of a player's winning percentage based on factors like effective field goal percentage, turnovers, offensive rebounding, and free throw attempt rate.\n",

    "###### Student Engagement Modeling Using Bayesian Networks    \n",
    "     This research paper addresses the challenge of modeling student engagement in computer-based scientific inquiry learning environments. Student engagement can be difficult to define and assess, and it fluctuates during the learning process. This study focuses on identifying variables related to engagement and constructing a Bayesian Network (BN) to capture the causal relationships among these variables. Two variations of the BN model were created and compared to other machine learning models for predictive accuracy.\n",
    "    The research highlights the positive correlation between student engagement and academic achievement, motivation, and a sense of belonging. However, measuring engagement's intrinsic properties remains challenging. Qualitative methods have been employed to identify factors affecting student engagement, but these methods are not scalable.\n",
    "    Bayesian Networks are used in this research as a modeling technique for student engagement. The construction of a BN involves the careful selection of relevant variables from the domain and defining their causal dependencies. This study represents an innovative application of BNs in student engagement modeling.\n",
    "    The research proposes two BN models with different arc directions to explore the causal dependencies between affect variables and overall student engagement. These models are compared to other data mining techniques, and the results suggest that the BN model with converging arcs is optimal, indicating that variables like belief, attention, goal, and confidence directly influence student engagement.However, the study has limitations, as it does not address temporal changes in student engagement, and the dataset is relatively small. Future work could involve modeling temporally variable engagement levels using Dynamic Bayesian Networks and collecting larger datasets for more robust analyses."

    "## 9- Pros and Cons of the Approach used \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros:\n",
    "1. *Customization:*\n",
    "   - We had full control over the implementation, allowing for specific customizations and adaptations to our unique dataset and requirements.\n",
    "2. *Learning Experience:*\n",
    "   - Implementing the Bayesian Network from scratch provides a valuable learning experience, enhancing our understanding of the theory and practical applications.\n",
    "3. *No Library Dependencies:*\n",
    "   - our implementation is not dependent on external libraries, reducing potential compatibility or dependency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "1. *Complexity:*\n",
    "   - Implementing Bayesian Networks manually can be complex and time-consuming, especially for those unfamiliar with the underlying mathematical concepts.\n",
    "2. *Error-Prone:*\n",
    "   - Without the validation and error handling built into libraries, manual implementations can be more susceptible to mistakes.\n",
    "3. *Efficiency:*\n",
    "   - Manual implementations may not be as efficient or optimized as those provided by well-maintained libraries, potentially leading to performance issues with larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOWEVER, \n",
    "It should be noted that\n",
    "Although Bayesian Networks are excellent for probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty management providing a graphical and mathematical representation of dependencies among variables making it highly interpretable, Bayesian Networks rely on the assumption of conditional independence, which might not always hold true in real-world scenarios and Even though they can work with limited data by incorporating prior knowledge, Bayesian Networks still require sufficient data to estimate conditional probability distributions accurately.Finally, in many cases, continuous variables need to be discretized, which can lead to a loss of information and precision."

    "##### 1. *Data Enhancement:*\n",
    "   - *Attribute Expansion:* We could Introduce more attributes that can influence the student's performance, such as health status, attendance etc..\n",
    "##### 2. *Model Complexity:*\n",
    "   - *Interactions:* Explore more complex interactions between attributes. Currently, the model is relatively simple. Adding more edges and considering indirect influences can make the model more comprehensive.\n",
    "   - *Factors:* Considering larger data set , having more possible combinations and connections between the features.\n",
    "##### 3. *Algorithm Enhancement:*\n",
    "   - *Learning Algorithms:* Explore different algorithms for learning the structure and parameters of the Bayesian Network to optimize performance.\n",
    "##### 4. *Validation and Testing:*\n",
    "   - *Cross-Validation:* Implement cross-validation techniques to validate the model's performance more rigorously."
